Write a Python script to transform data as specified below.

Requirements:
- Read from stdin or file path argument
- Write to stdout (pipeable)
- Handle errors gracefully (malformed rows, missing fields)
- Include a brief --help message
- Use standard library only (no pip installs)
- Log warnings to stderr, not stdout

Sample input data:
```
{context}
```

Transformation needed:
{task}

Output ONLY the Python script. No explanations.
