Perform a first-pass code review of this source file.

Check for:
1. Obvious bugs (off-by-one, null derefs, unhandled errors)
2. Security issues (injection, path traversal, hardcoded secrets)
3. Performance problems (O(n^2) in hot paths, unnecessary allocations)
4. Style issues (inconsistent naming, dead code, missing error handling)
5. Logic errors (wrong conditions, missing edge cases)
