Generate a Python web scraper configuration for the following source.

Output a Python dict with:
- name: source identifier (lowercase-hyphenated)
- base_url: root URL
- article_selector: CSS selector for article links on listing pages
- title_selector: CSS selector for article title
- content_selector: CSS selector for main content body
- pagination: dict with type (next_link|page_number|scroll), selector
- rate_limit: seconds between requests (minimum 2)
- robots_txt: whether to respect (always True)
- estimated_articles: rough count

Also include a brief scraping strategy (2-3 sentences) noting any anti-scraping measures or unusual page structure.

Source to scrape:
{task}

Reference scraper code (for style matching):
```
{context}
```

Output ONLY the Python dict and strategy note. No full script.
