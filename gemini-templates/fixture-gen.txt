Generate pytest fixtures for testing code that uses these data structures.

Requirements:
- One fixture per logical test scenario (happy path, edge case, error case)
- Use @pytest.fixture with descriptive names
- Include factory fixtures for parameterized testing
- Add docstrings explaining what each fixture represents
- Include both valid and invalid data variants
- Use tmp_path for any file-based fixtures

Source code with data structures:
```
{context}
```

{task}

Output ONLY the fixture code (no test functions). No explanations.
