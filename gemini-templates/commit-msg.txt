Write a git commit message for the following diff.

Rules:
- First line: imperative mood, under 72 chars (e.g., "Fix contrast ratios for WCAG AA compliance")
- Focus on WHY, not WHAT (the diff shows what changed)
- If multiple concerns, use bullet points in body
- No period at end of subject line
- Blank line between subject and body

Diff:
```
{context}
```

{task}

Output ONLY the commit message text. No markdown fences.
