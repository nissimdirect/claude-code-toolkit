## Part 0: The Academic Canon — Primary Research Papers

These are the foundational studies. Everything else in this doc is derived from or validated by these.

### 0.1 Berger & Milkman (2012) — "What Makes Online Content Viral?"
**Journal:** Journal of Marketing Research, 49(2), 192-205. [SAGE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmr.10.0353) | [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1528077)
**Cited:** 1,333+ times. Sage 10-Year Impact Award.

**Method:** Analyzed every NYT article published over 3 months. Coded for emotional content, practical value, surprise, interest. Tracked which made the "most emailed" list. Then ran controlled experiments to establish causation.

**Core findings:**
- **Arousal, not valence, drives sharing.** Positive content is more viral than negative — BUT high-arousal negative (anger, anxiety) beats low-arousal positive (contentment).
- **Awe is the #1 viral emotion.** Awe-inspiring content was 30% more likely to make the most-emailed list.
- **Practical value matters.** Useful content gets shared. But it's additive with emotion, not a replacement.
- **Surprise boosts sharing.** Independent of emotion.
- **Causal proof:** They didn't just observe correlation. Experiments showed that INDUCING high arousal in subjects increased sharing behavior. They had people jog in place (physical arousal) and those people shared more content afterward. Arousal itself — regardless of source — increases transmission.

**The mechanism:** Arousal activates the autonomic nervous system → increases action tendency → sharing is an action → aroused people share more. This is physiological, not just psychological.

### 0.2 Vosoughi, Roy & Aral (2018) — "The Spread of True and False News Online"
**Journal:** Science, 359(6380), 1146-1151. [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap9559) | [MIT PDF](https://politics.media.mit.edu/papers/Vosoughi_Science.pdf)

**Method:** Analyzed ~126,000 verified true and false stories on Twitter, tweeted by ~3 million people, 4.5 million times, 2006-2017. Largest study of misinformation spread ever conducted.

**Core findings:**
- **Falsehood diffused farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than truth in ALL categories.** Not just politics — science, business, entertainment, all of it.
- **Top 1% false cascades reached 1,000-100,000 people.** Truth rarely reached 1,000.
- **False news was 70% more likely to be retweeted than true news.**
- **Novelty was the key driver.** False news was rated as more "novel" by recipients. Novel = unexpected = surprising = arousing (links to Berger).
- **Emotional signatures differ:** False news inspired fear, disgust, surprise. True news inspired sadness, joy, trust, anticipation.
- **Bots spread true and false equally.** HUMANS are the differential — we preferentially share novel/surprising content.

**Implication for content creation:** Novelty is the engine. Content that presents familiar things in unfamiliar ways (glitch art literally does this) has a structural advantage. You don't need to be false — you need to be novel.

### 0.3 Kramer, Guillory & Hancock (2014) — "Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion"
**Journal:** PNAS, 111(24), 8788-8790. [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320040111)

**Method:** Facebook manipulated News Feeds of 689,003 users for one week. Reduced positive OR negative emotional content. Measured users' subsequent posting behavior.

**Core findings:**
- **Emotions transfer through text alone.** No face-to-face needed. No voice. Just words on a screen.
- **Reducing positive content in feeds → users posted more negative content (and fewer positive words).**
- **Reducing negative content → users posted more positive content.**
- **Emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction** — merely being exposed to emotional content changes your emotional output.

**Implication:** Your content's emotional tone literally changes how your audience feels and what they subsequently create/share. Positive, high-arousal content (awe, excitement) creates a positive contagion cascade through your audience's networks.

### 0.4 Watts & Dodds (2007) — "Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation"
**Journal:** Journal of Consumer Research, 34(4), 441-458. [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/34/4/441/1820236)

**Core findings:**
- **Large cascades are NOT driven by "influencers."** They're driven by a critical mass of easily influenced individuals.
- **Network structure matters more than individual node influence.** Graph density predicts cascade size better than any individual's follower count.
- **Implication:** Don't chase influencer partnerships. Instead, make content that's easy for REGULAR people to share. The viral cascade depends on whether ordinary viewers feel compelled to pass it along, not whether a big account posts it.

### 0.5 Centola (2010) — "The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experiment"
**Journal:** Science, 329(5996), 1194-1197. [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1185231)

**Key distinction — Simple vs. Complex Contagion:**
- **Simple contagion** (information, disease): one exposure is enough to "infect." Spreads faster through weak ties and random networks.
- **Complex contagion** (behavior adoption, identity-linked actions): requires MULTIPLE exposures from MULTIPLE sources. Spreads faster through clustered networks with redundant ties.

**Implication:** Signing up for something, changing a habit, or adopting a new tool = complex contagion. People need to see MULTIPLE friends using/sharing your content before they adopt it themselves. This is why niche communities (subreddits, Discord servers, producer forums) are better launch points than broad audiences — the clustering provides the redundant exposure needed for behavioral adoption.

### 0.6 Christakis & Fowler (2008) — "Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network"
**Journal:** BMJ, 337, a2338. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2600606/)

**Method:** 20-year longitudinal study. 4,739 people from the Framingham Heart Study.

**Core finding — Three Degrees of Influence:**
- Happiness spreads up to 3 degrees of separation (friend's friend's friend)
- A happy friend within 1 mile → 25% increase in your happiness probability
- Happy next-door neighbor → 34% increase

**Implication:** The emotional impact of your content doesn't stop at the first viewer. If your content makes someone feel inspired/awed, their subsequent social behavior (posts, interactions) carries that emotion to their network, and their network's network. You're not just reaching your viewers — you're reaching 3 hops out.

### 0.7 Loewenstein (1994) — "The Psychology of Curiosity: A Review and Reinterpretation"
**Journal:** Psychological Bulletin, 116(1), 75-98. [APA PsycNet](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-41058-001)

**The Information Gap Theory:**
- Curiosity = aversive state caused by awareness of an information gap
- The gap must be SPECIFIC (vague curiosity doesn't motivate)
- Moderate gaps are most motivating (too small = boring, too large = overwhelming)
- Prior knowledge INCREASES curiosity (the more you know, the more you realize you don't know)

**For content hooks:** The best hooks create a gap that feels closeable within the video's runtime. "What happens when..." "The one thing most producers miss..." "I've been doing this wrong for years..."

## Part 1: The Psychology — Why Humans Share

### 1.1 Berger's STEPPS Framework (Deeper Than the Summary)

Source: Jonah Berger, Wharton School. *Contagious: Why Things Catch On* (2013).

| Principle | Mechanism | How to Exploit It |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Social Currency** | People share what makes them look smart, cool, or in-the-know. Sharing = identity performance. | Make your content feel like insider knowledge. "Most producers don't know this..." |
| **Triggers** | Environmental cues cause people to think about your content. Frequency of trigger > strength of trigger. | Link your content to everyday creative moments: opening a DAW, watching a tutorial, hearing a song |
| **Emotion** | HIGH-AROUSAL emotions drive sharing. Low-arousal (sadness, contentment) does NOT. | Target: awe, excitement, amusement, anxiety, anger. NOT: sadness, relaxation |
| **Public** | Observable behavior gets imitated. If people can see others using/sharing it, they'll follow. | Make the output visible — screen recordings, before/after, live demos |
| **Practical Value** | People share useful things. "News you can use." | Tutorials, tips, free tools, templates — give away value |
| **Stories** | Narrative is the Trojan horse for ideas. People share stories, not facts. | Frame demos as journeys: "I fed a boring video into this and..." |

**Key insight from Berger's research:** Emotional arousal is the mechanism, not emotional valence. Content that makes you *activated* (heart rate up, alert, energized) gets shared. Content that makes you *deactivated* (calm, sad, relaxed) doesn't — even if it's positive.

**High-arousal positive:** Awe, excitement, amusement, inspiration
**High-arousal negative:** Anger, anxiety, disgust
**Low-arousal (won't spread):** Sadness, contentment, relaxation

### 1.2 Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory

Source: George Loewenstein, Carnegie Mellon. *The Psychology of Curiosity* (1994). Published in Psychological Bulletin.

Curiosity = the feeling of deprivation caused by a gap between what you know and what you want to know.

**The mechanism:**
1. Person becomes aware they don't know something specific
2. This creates an uncomfortable state (like hunger)
3. The discomfort drives action to close the gap (click, watch, read)
4. Closing the gap provides relief (reward)

**For viral content:** Create a visible gap in the first 1-3 seconds.
- "What happens when you run a video through 12 glitch effects at once?" (gap: the result)
- "This one setting changed my entire mix" (gap: which setting?)
- "POV: you just found a tool that does THIS" (gap: what does it do?)

**Critical:** The gap must be specific enough to feel closeable. Vague gaps ("something interesting happened") don't work. The viewer needs to believe the answer is coming.

### 1.3 Kahneman's System 1/System 2 and Sharing

Source: Daniel Kahneman. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (2011).

- **System 1** (fast, automatic, emotional) drives sharing decisions
- **System 2** (slow, deliberate, rational) would often say "don't share that"
- Social media is designed for System 1: endless scroll, autoplay, swipe-based interaction

**Implication:** Viral content must be instantly graspable. If it requires explanation, System 2 activates and the share impulse dies. The first frame/second must communicate the concept at a gut level.

**For visual/audio content:** This is an advantage. Glitch art, visualizers, and music are inherently System 1 — they're processed emotionally before intellectually.

### 1.4 Social Identity Theory and Sharing as Self-Performance

Source: Henri Tajfel & John Turner (1979). Extended by Berger and others.

People don't share content — they share *themselves*. Every share is an identity signal:
- "I'm the kind of person who knows about experimental tools"
- "I'm a creative technologist"
- "I'm in-the-know about underground music production"

**The identity stack for PopChaos content:**
- **For music producers:** "I discover the weirdest tools before they blow up"
- **For visual artists:** "I make art with code and chaos"
- **For tech-curious:** "I found something you've never seen before"

**Make your content easy to share as identity performance.** The share caption should write itself: "yo look at this" or "this is insane" or "how is this free?"

### 1.5 Emotional Contagion in Digital Media

Source: Goldenberg & Gross, Harvard/Stanford. *Digital Emotion Contagion* (2020). Also: Kramer, Guillory & Hancock, PNAS (2014) — the Facebook emotional contagion study.

Emotions spread through networks like viruses. In digital contexts:
- Emotional content gets more engagement than neutral content
- The emotion transfers: viewers FEEL what the content expresses
- High-arousal emotions spread faster (consistent with Berger)
- Visual content transmits emotion faster than text

**For PopChaos:** Your visual experiments (glitch art, visualizers) are emotional media by default. The question is which emotion you're triggering.

### 1.6 Nir Eyal's Hook Model + Variable Reward Schedules

Source: Nir Eyal. *Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products* (2014). Built on B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning.

**The Hook:** Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment

**Variable rewards come in three types:**
1. **Rewards of the Tribe** — social validation (likes, comments, follows)
2. **Rewards of the Hunt** — seeking resources/information (scrolling for the next hit)
3. **Rewards of the Self** — mastery, completion, self-expression

**Dopamine mechanism:** Dopamine surges in ANTICIPATION of reward, not upon receiving it. Unpredictable rewards (variable schedule) generate MORE dopamine than predictable ones. This is why scrolling is addictive — each swipe might deliver something amazing.

**For content strategy:** Each post should deliver a micro-reward while creating anticipation for what's next. Series formats ("Part 1 of..."), recurring themes, and progressive reveals exploit this.

### 1.7 Mirror Neurons and Video Content

Source: Rizzolatti et al. (1996), Parma. Extended by Iacoboni, UCLA.

Mirror neurons fire both when you perform an action AND when you watch someone else perform it. This is the neural basis of empathy and "feeling" what you see.

**For creative process content:** When viewers watch someone create — tweaking knobs, adjusting parameters, getting excited at the result — their mirror neurons fire. They FEEL the creation process. This is why "process reveal" videos work: viewers experience vicarious creation satisfaction.

## Part 2: Platform-Specific Algorithm Science

### 2.1 TikTok (For You Page)

**Primary signals (ranked by weight):**
1. Watch time / completion rate (~40-50% of algorithm weight)
2. Rewatches / replays
3. Shares (weighted above likes since 2025)
4. Saves
5. Comments (quality > quantity now)
6. Follows from video

**Distribution model:** Small test audience → measure signals → expand if positive → repeat

**Key thresholds:**
- 70%+ completion rate = aggressive boost (up from 50% in 2024)
- 75-100% completion = viral territory
- First 1-2 hours of engagement determine trajectory

**2026 changes:**
- Videos tested with FOLLOWERS first, then non-followers
- Original audio and production quality now factor into ranking
- Comment depth (length, substance) matters more than count
- TikTok SEO: keywords in captions, on-screen text, and spoken audio scanned

**Why 7-second videos go mega-viral:** High completion rate is mathematically easier to achieve. A 7-second video with 95% completion beats a 60-second video with 40% completion every time.

**Best for PopChaos:** Short, punchy glitch transformations. Before/after reveals. "What X sounds like through Y effect."

### 2.2 Instagram Reels

**Primary signals (confirmed by Adam Mosseri, Jan 2025):**
1. Watch time (% of video watched)
2. Likes per reach
3. Sends per reach (DM shares — STRONGEST signal for new audiences)

**Key differences from TikTok:**
- Reels shown to random NON-followers first, then followers (opposite of TikTok's 2026 change)
- "Originality Score" penalizes recycled/watermarked content from other platforms
- First 3 seconds = critical retention threshold ("intro retention")
- 70%+ intro retention = strong performer
- Instagram HATES TikTok watermarks — will tank your reach

**Content strategy:**
- Must feel native to Instagram (polished, aesthetic)
- DM shares > likes for algorithmic boost
- Carousel posts also perform well on Instagram (not an option on TikTok)

**Best for PopChaos:** Polished visual experiments. Aesthetic glitch art. Clean before/after with satisfying reveal.

### 2.3 YouTube Shorts

**Key differences from long-form YouTube:**
- NO CTR metric (users swipe, don't click)
- Primary metric: "viewed vs. swiped away" + replay count
- Completion rate > absolute watch time (30-sec at 85% beats 60-sec at 50%)
- Fully decoupled recommendation engine from long-form (late 2025)
- Shorts now appear in search results as first-class content
- Shorts act as discovery → funnel to long-form

**Distribution model:** "Explore & Exploit" — new Short tested on seed audience, expanded if positive.

**Unique advantage:** Shorts can funnel viewers to long-form content. Cross-format promotion strategy: Shorts for discovery, long-form for depth.

**Best for PopChaos:** Short demo clips that tease longer tutorials. Process reveals. Search-optimized Shorts ("how to glitch a video", "weird audio effects").

### 2.4 Twitter/X

**Engagement signal weights:**
| Action | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Like | ×1 |
| Bookmark | ×10 |
| Link Click | ×11 |
| Profile Click | ×12 |
| Reply | ×13.5 |
| Retweet | ×20 |
| Author reply to reply | ×75 |

**Key differences:**
- Text-only posts outperform video by 30% (ONLY major platform where this is true)
- Since March 2026: non-Premium accounts posting links get ZERO median engagement
- Premium accounts get 4× visibility boost (in-network) and 2× (out-of-network)
- Threads and conversation drive algorithmic boost
- Controversy and ratio drive distribution (high-arousal negative emotions)

**Best for PopChaos:** Text posts with embedded media. Hot takes about creative tools. Threads showing process. Engagement farming through questions/polls.

**Critical:** You need X Premium for link posts to be visible.

### 2.5 Reddit

**Core mechanics:**
- Time-decay model: early upvotes carry exponentially more weight
- 5-7 upvotes in first 6 minutes = algorithm flags as notable
- 50 upvotes in first hour >>> 200 upvotes over 24 hours
- Comments are weighted heavily — discussion-sparking posts outperform

**r/all pathway:**
1. Win your niche subreddit first
2. Cross-subreddit appeal detected (upvotes from diverse user bases)
3. Promoted to r/popular then r/all
4. Typically needs 1,000+ upvotes in 2-4 hours for front page

**Optimal timing:** Weekday mornings 8-10 AM EST, early evenings 6-8 PM EST

**Subreddit selection matters enormously:** Large subs (r/funny) need massive velocity. Niche subs (r/glitchart, r/musicproduction, r/audioengineering, r/generative) need much less.

**Best for PopChaos:** Post glitch art to r/glitchart, r/datamoshing, r/generative. Music production tips to r/musicproduction. Tool demos to r/audioengineering, r/synthesizers.

### 2.6 LinkedIn

**Fundamental difference:** LinkedIn is "not designed for virality" — their words.

**Primary signal:** Dwell time (seconds spent on post). 30+ seconds = flagged for broader distribution.

**The "Golden Hour":** First 60-90 minutes determine reach.
- Author responses within 30 minutes → 64% more comments, 2.3× more views
- Comments count 2× as much as likes
- Video posts get 5× higher engagement than other formats
- Image posts get 2× more comments than text-only

**LinkedIn's unique virality pattern:**
- Vulnerability + expertise = viral (not humblebragging — genuine openness about struggle + domain knowledge)
- Framework/list posts perform well ("5 things I learned building X")
- Niche expertise gets boosted (LinkedIn tracks your topic authority)
- 72-hour shelf life (much longer than Twitter's ~30 minutes)

**Best for PopChaos:** Process stories about building tools. Frameworks. "I built X and here's what happened." Not product promotion — thought leadership about creative technology.

## Part 3: The Viral Content Taxonomy for Creative/Music/Tech

### 3.1 Formats That Go Viral in Creative Niches

| Format | Why It Works | Psychology | Platform Sweet Spot |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Process Reveal** | Mirror neurons + curiosity gap + transformation satisfaction | Vicarious creation experience | TikTok, Reels, Shorts |
| **Before/After** | Information gap + awe/surprise + practical value | "How did they do that?" | All platforms |
| **Tool Demo** | Social currency + practical value | "I discovered this first" | TikTok, Reddit, Twitter |
| **Satisfying Loop** | Dopamine + completion reward + rewatch incentive | Hypnotic/meditative engagement | TikTok, Reels (loop-optimized) |
| **Mistake → Fix** | Relatability + practical value + narrative arc | "I've been there" | YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit |
| **Speed Build** | Awe + time compression + skill display | Efficiency porn | TikTok, Shorts, Reels |
| **Sound Design Reveal** | Curiosity gap + practical value + surprise | "That's how they made that sound?!" | TikTok, Reddit |
| **Destruction/Chaos** | High arousal + novelty + transgression thrill | Breaking rules = exciting | TikTok, Twitter |

### 3.2 Why Glitch Art Goes Viral

Glitch art activates multiple viral psychology mechanisms simultaneously:
1. **Novelty** — each glitch is unique, unpredictable (variable reward)
2. **Transgression** — it looks "wrong" in a way that's exciting (emotional arousal)
3. **Transformation** — normal → glitched is inherently a before/after
4. **Beauty from destruction** — cognitive dissonance creates awe
5. **Accessibility** — anyone can appreciate it without technical knowledge (System 1)
6. **Shareability** — visual content travels faster than text or audio

### 3.3 Why Music Production Content Goes Viral

- **Sound design reveals** exploit the curiosity gap ("how did they make THAT sound?")
- **Before/after mixing** is the audio equivalent of a makeover
- **Gear/tool discovery** triggers social currency ("I found this before everyone else")
- **Recreating famous sounds** combines nostalgia + education + surprise

## Part 4: The Retrofit Flywheel — Concept Extraction Engine

### 4.1 The Process

```
MONITOR → IDENTIFY → EXTRACT → REINTERPRET → CREATE → DISTRIBUTE → MEASURE → REPEAT
```

1. **MONITOR** — Scrape trending content from all platforms daily
2. **IDENTIFY** — Flag content with unusual engagement velocity
3. **EXTRACT** — Analyze the viral element (not the content, the CONCEPT):
   - What emotion does it trigger? (awe, curiosity, humor, anger)
   - What hook structure? (information gap, social currency, transformation)
   - What format? (before/after, process reveal, list, challenge)
   - What makes it rewatchable? (satisfying loop, hidden detail, variable reward)
4. **REINTERPRET** — Map the concept to your domain:
   - Viral dance challenge concept → "challenge" format for glitch effects
   - Viral recipe reveal → "recipe" format for sound design
   - Viral transformation → before/after with your tools
5. **CREATE** — Produce content using your tools (Entropic, Chaos Visualizer, sample packs)
6. **DISTRIBUTE** — Adapt for each platform's native format and algorithm
7. **MEASURE** — Track what worked, feed back into the system

### 4.2 Concept Extraction Prompt Template

Use this to analyze any viral content:

```
Analyze this viral [video/post/tweet]:

1. EMOTION: What primary emotion does it trigger in the first 3 seconds?
2. HOOK: What information gap or curiosity mechanism is used?
3. FORMAT: What structural template does it follow?
4. IDENTITY: What does sharing this say about the sharer?
5. REWARD: What satisfaction does the viewer get from watching to completion?
6. REWATCH: What element makes this rewatchable?
7. ADAPT: How could this concept be applied to [glitch art / music production / creative tools]?
```

### 4.3 Cross-Platform Adaptation Matrix

| From → To | Key Modifications |
|-----------|-------------------|
| TikTok → Reels | Remove TikTok watermark. Slightly more polished aesthetic. Same hook structure works. |
| TikTok → Shorts | Same format works well. Add search-optimized title/description. Can be slightly longer. |
| TikTok → Twitter | Extract the hook as text. Attach video natively. Add a spicy caption. |
| TikTok → Reddit | Write a descriptive title (Reddit is title-dependent). Post to relevant subreddit. Add context in comments. |
| TikTok → LinkedIn | Reframe as a lesson/insight. Add professional context. "Here's what I learned building..." |
| Reddit → TikTok | If a post blew up on Reddit, the concept has cross-platform potential. Create a video version. |
| Twitter → All | If a tweet went viral, the concept is proven. Create visual content around it. |

---

## Part 5: Platform-Specific Posting Optimization

### 5.1 Best Posting Times (Aggregate Research)

| Platform | Best Times (EST) | Best Days | Source |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| TikTok | 7-9 AM, 12-3 PM, 7-11 PM | Tue, Thu, Fri | Sprout Social 2026 |
| Instagram | 11 AM-1 PM, 7-9 PM | Tue, Wed, Fri | Buffer 2026 |
| YouTube | 2-4 PM (for evening consumption) | Thu, Fri, Sat | vidIQ 2025 |
| Twitter/X | 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM | Mon-Wed | Sprout Social 2026 |
| Reddit | 8-10 AM, 6-8 PM | Mon-Thu | Hootsuite 2025 |
| LinkedIn | 7-8 AM, 12 PM, 5-6 PM | Tue-Thu | Hootsuite 2026 |

### 5.2 Content Format Specs

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Length | Caption Style | Hashtag Strategy |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| TikTok | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 10 min (sweet spot: 7-30 sec) | Conversational, keyword-rich | 3-5 targeted, mix niche + trending |
| Reels | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 90 sec (sweet spot: 15-30 sec) | Clean, concise | 5-10, more than TikTok |
| Shorts | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 60 sec (sweet spot: 15-30 sec) | Search-optimized title | Title and description matter most |
| Twitter/X | 16:9 or 1:1 for media | 280 chars + media | Punchy, provocative | 1-2 max, often none |
| Reddit | Any (prefer 16:9 for video) | Subreddit rules vary | Descriptive title is EVERYTHING | None (Reddit hates hashtags) |
| LinkedIn | 1:1, 4:5, or 16:9 | 3 min video, 3000 char posts | Professional but personal | 3-5 industry-relevant |

---

## Part 6: Dark Patterns & Sustainability

### 6.1 What Works Short-Term but Kills Long-Term

| Tactic | Short-Term Effect | Long-Term Cost |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Controversy farming | High engagement spikes | Toxic audience, brand damage, platform shadow-ban risk |
| Engagement bait ("Like if you agree") | Inflated metrics | Algorithm now detects and penalizes this on most platforms |
| Stolen/reposted content | Quick views | Copyright strikes, originality score tanks, no audience loyalty |
| Clickbait with no payoff | High initial CTR | Plummeting completion rate, algorithm learns to suppress |
| Posting frequency over quality | Consistent presence | Audience fatigue, reduced per-post performance |

### 6.2 Sustainable Virality = Audience Building

Virality without audience capture = wasted attention. Every viral moment should:
1. Point to your profile (strong bio with links)
2. Have a follow-up ready (the next video, the series, the product)
3. Capture contact info (fan capture gate — already built at ~/Development/fan-capture-mvp/)
4. Build identity association ("the glitch art person", "the chaos tools person")
