## How This Doc Works

The psychology reference explains WHY things go viral. This playbook gives you the WHAT and HOW — practical building blocks you combine however you want. Nothing here is mandatory. Everything is a tool in a toolbox.

---

## Part 1: Hook Structures — The Opening Move

Every piece of short-form content lives or dies in 1-3 seconds. These are proven hook structures organized by the psychology they exploit. Pick whichever matches your content.

### 1.1 By Psychological Mechanism

**Curiosity Gap (Loewenstein)** — Create a specific, closeable information gap:
- "Watch what happens when I run this through 12 effects at once"
- "There's one setting most people never touch"
- "I've been doing this wrong for 3 years"
- "Nobody talks about this feature"

**Social Currency (Berger)** — Make the viewer look smart for sharing:
- "This tool exists and nobody knows about it"
- "I found the one free alternative to [expensive thing]"
- "The trick every pro knows but won't share"
- "Why every serious producer should know about [X]"

**Contrarian (High Arousal)** — Challenge conventional wisdom:
- "Stop doing [common practice]"
- "[Popular tool] is actually terrible for [use case]"
- "Everything you know about [X] is wrong"
- "The reason your [thing] sounds amateur isn't what you think"

**Transformation (Awe)** — Before/after reveal:
- "[Normal thing] → [completely transformed thing]" (no words, just visual)
- "From boring to beautiful in 3 seconds"
- "Same video, completely different vibe"
- Show the boring input, then smash cut to the wild output

**Process Reveal (Mirror Neurons)** — Show creation happening:
- Screen recording of parameter tweaking with the result changing in real-time
- Hands-on-controls POV shots
- "Making [thing] from scratch in [time]"

**Practical Value** — Teach something useful:
- "How to [achieve goal] in [time/steps]"
- "3 things I do before every [activity]"
- "[X] vs [Y] — which one wins?"
- "Try this so you don't have to"

### 1.2 Visual/Audio-First Hooks (No Words Needed)

For content where the VISUAL is the hook — particularly relevant for glitch art and visualizers:

- **The Smash Cut:** Start with a familiar image/video, then immediately cut to the glitched version. No text. The visual contrast IS the hook.
- **The Build:** Start from nothing, watch complexity accumulate in real-time. Mesmerizing. High rewatch potential.
- **The Loop:** End state seamlessly connects to start state. TikTok and Reels auto-loop, so a perfect loop gets replayed automatically (boosting completion metrics).
- **The Sync:** Visual effects synced to music. The rhythmic alignment triggers awe + satisfaction simultaneously.
- **The Accident:** "I didn't mean to do this but..." — happy accidents are relatable and novel.

### 1.3 Technical Details That Matter

- 85% of users watch without sound. Your first frame needs bold on-screen text OR a purely visual hook.
- Bold captions increase completion rates ~40%.
- The hook IS the content for the algorithm. Everything after second 3 is retention.
- Vertical 9:16 is non-negotiable for TikTok/Reels/Shorts.

## Part 2: Content Format Menu

Pick a format that fits what you're making today. Each format is tagged with which products it naturally showcases.

### 2.1 Short-Form Formats (7-60 seconds)

| Format | Description | Products | Psychology |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Before/After** | Normal input → processed output. Hard cut or transition. | Entropic, Glitch Video | Transformation awe, curiosity gap |
| **Speed Build** | Full creation process compressed into 15-30 seconds | Chaos Visualizer, Music Composer | Awe, mirror neurons |
| **Tool Discovery** | "This exists and it does THIS" — quick capability showcase | Entropic, Terminal Sample Pack | Social currency, practical value |
| **X vs Y** | Compare two approaches, tools, or effects side by side | Entropic vs CapCut, Real datamosh vs simulated | Curiosity gap, practical value |
| **Effect Cascade** | Stack multiple effects sequentially, each one more extreme | Entropic (chain recipes) | Variable reward, building intensity |
| **Sound → Visual** | Feed audio into visualizer, show the result | Chaos Visualizer + any music | Synesthesia fascination, awe |
| **Satisfying Loop** | Create a seamless loop that auto-replays hypnotically | Chaos Visualizer, Entropic | Dopamine, completion reward |
| **Mistake → Fix** | Show something going wrong, then how you fixed it | Any tool | Relatability, practical value |
| **3 Things** | "3 effects you didn't know existed" / "3 ways to use [X]" | Any | Practical value, structured curiosity |

### 2.2 Medium-Form Formats (1-5 minutes)

| Format | Description | Products | Platform |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Tutorial** | Step-by-step how to achieve a specific result | Any | YouTube, Reddit |
| **Breakdown** | Analyze how a viral visual effect was created | Entropic | YouTube, Twitter/X |
| **Process Journal** | Document a full creative session with commentary | Any | YouTube, LinkedIn |
| **Challenge** | "Can I recreate [famous effect] using only [tool]?" | Entropic, Chaos Visualizer | TikTok, YouTube |
| **Collection** | "Every glitch effect in Entropic ranked" / "All 126 effects demo" | Entropic | YouTube |

### 2.3 Text-First Formats (Twitter/X, Reddit, LinkedIn)

| Format | Structure | Platform |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Thread** | Step-by-step process or framework, 5-10 tweets | Twitter/X |
| **Hot Take** | Contrarian opinion with evidence | Twitter/X |
| **Show Your Work** | Share metrics, learnings, process from building | Twitter/X, LinkedIn |
| **Deep Dive Post** | Long-form analysis of a technique or trend | Reddit, LinkedIn |
| **Question Post** | Ask the community something genuine | Reddit, Twitter/X |

## Part 3: The Content Batch — Workflow Options

Content creation is most efficient in batches. Here are workflow shapes — pick what fits your schedule and energy.

### 3.1 The Weekly Sprint (4-6 hours/week)

| Session | Time | What |
|---------|------|------|
| Ideation | 30 min | Pull 5-10 concepts from trend sources + your product capabilities |
| Recording | 2-3 hours | Capture 5-10 videos in one sitting. Vertical 9:16 from the start. |
| Editing | 1-2 hours | Batch edit all videos. Add captions. Export per-platform versions. |
| Distribution | 1 hour | Write captions per platform. Upload natively. Schedule remaining. |

### 3.2 The Daily Drop (30 min/day)

- Capture 1 thing per day as you work on your actual projects
- Screen record while using Entropic, Chaos Visualizer, or making music
- Edit in <10 min (trim, add caption, export)
- Post to 1-2 platforms natively

### 3.3 The Reservoir (Occasional Burst)

- Whenever creative energy is high, record a bunch of raw material
- Don't edit immediately — stockpile
- Edit and post from the reservoir when energy is lower
- Good for avoiding "I need to create content today" pressure

### 3.4 The Recycler

- Take existing work (Entropic output, visualizer recordings, finished music)
- Recut into short-form content
- One long piece can yield 5-15 short clips
- Tools: Opus Clip (AI clip extraction, free tier), manual trim in CapCut

---

## Part 4: Tool Stack — Free Tier First

### 4.1 Creation Tools

| Purpose | Tool | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Short-form editing | CapCut | Free | Auto-captions, templates, TikTok-native |
| Clip extraction from long-form | Opus Clip | Free tier | AI selects best clips, assigns "viral score" |
| Caption generation | CapCut or Descript | Free | Both auto-generate. CapCut faster for short-form. |
| Caption writing (per-platform) | ChatGPT / Claude | Free tier / existing | Generate platform-adapted captions from one core message |
| Thumbnail | Canva | Free tier | Templates, direct export to YouTube |

### 4.2 Distribution Tools

| Purpose | Tool | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Multi-platform scheduling | Buffer | Free (3 channels, 10 posts each) | Most versatile free tier |
| Scheduling + analytics | Metricool | Free (50 posts/month) | Best free analytics |
| Instagram-focused | Later | Free (limited posts) | Best for grid planning |

**Important:** Native upload for first 24 hours outperforms scheduled posts algorithmically. Use schedulers for non-peak platforms.

### 4.3 Trend Monitoring

| Tool | Cost | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| TikTok Creative Center | Free | Trending sounds, hashtags, formats. Filter by region + time. THE primary source. |
| Google Trends | Free | Search interest over time. Compare up to 5 terms. |
| TikTok/Instagram in-app | Free | Manual scroll with "creator brain" — observe formats, not just content |
| Exploding Topics | Free tier | Predicts trends 6-24 months early (surface data free) |
| Kapwing Trends Blog | Free | Monthly TikTok trend roundups with creator examples |

### 4.4 Analytics (All Free)

| Platform | Where | Key Metrics to Watch |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| TikTok | TikTok Analytics (Pro account, free) | Completion rate, shares, saves |
| Instagram | Instagram Insights (Creator account, free) | DM shares (strongest algo signal), intro retention |
| YouTube | YouTube Studio (free) | Retention curve shape, CTR (long-form), "viewed vs swiped" (Shorts) |
| Cross-platform | Metricool free tier | Unified view, best-time-to-post, competitor tracking |

**What to actually track (not vanity metrics):**
- Completion rate / watch time — this is what algorithms optimize for
- Saves and shares — higher-signal engagement than likes
- Follower conversion rate — is content turning viewers into followers?
- Referral traffic to fan-capture-mvp — is content driving email signups?

## Part 5: Platform Adaptation — One Piece, Many Shapes

When you create one piece of content, adapt it for each platform rather than cross-posting the exact same thing.

### 5.1 Adaptation Quick Reference

| Platform | Aspect | Sweet Spot Length | Caption Style | Hashtag Style |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| TikTok | 9:16 | 7-30 sec | Casual, keyword-rich, question hooks | 3-5 targeted, mix niche + trending |
| Reels | 9:16 | 15-30 sec | Story-first, CTA above "more" fold | 5-10 |
| Shorts | 9:16 | 15-30 sec | Search-optimized, descriptive | Title + description matter most |
| Twitter/X | 16:9 or 1:1 | Any (text-first platform) | Punchy, provocative | 1-2 max |
| Reddit | Any (prefer 16:9) | Subreddit rules vary | Descriptive title is EVERYTHING | None (Reddit hates hashtags) |
| LinkedIn | 1:1, 4:5, 16:9 | Up to 3 min | Professional but personal | 3-5 industry-relevant |

### 5.2 Upload Sequence (When Posting Same-Day)

If posting to multiple platforms on the same day, stagger by 30-60 min in this order:
1. TikTok (fastest algorithm feedback loop)
2. Instagram Reels
3. YouTube Shorts
4. LinkedIn
5. Twitter/X
6. Reddit (choose the right subreddit — r/glitchart, r/musicproduction, r/generative, r/datamoshing)

### 5.3 What NOT to Do

- Never post with another platform's watermark (Instagram and TikTok both suppress this)
- Never use identical captions across platforms (each has different conventions)
- Never schedule-post to TikTok for first 24 hours (native upload outperforms)

---

## Part 6: Trend Monitoring Cadence Options

### 6.1 Light Touch (15 min/week)

- Monday: Check TikTok Creative Center trending tab (7-day filter)
- Note 2-3 formats or sounds relevant to your niche
- Plan 1-2 pieces of content around a trend format

### 6.2 Active Tracking (35 min/week)

- Monday (15 min): TikTok Creative Center + Exploding Topics for emerging terms
- Wednesday (10 min): Scroll FYP with creator brain. Note formats you see 3+ times.
- Friday (10 min): Read Kapwing or Ramdam weekly trend report. Plan next week.

### 6.3 System-Level (Future Build)

The virality reference doc outlines a trend monitor + LLM analysis pipeline that could automate monitoring:
- YouTube API + Reddit API + Google Trends → daily scrape
- LLM-powered concept extraction using the template in VIRALITY-PSYCHOLOGY-REFERENCE.md Part 4.2
- Output: daily Obsidian digest with format opportunities

This isn't built yet. It's in the roadmap.

---

## Part 7: Concept Extraction — Stealing Like an Artist

When you see something going viral in ANY niche, extract the concept, not the content.

### 7.1 The Quick Extract (30 seconds per piece)

For any viral video/post you encounter:
1. **What emotion?** (awe, curiosity, humor, anger, surprise)
2. **What hook structure?** (curiosity gap, transformation, contrarian, discovery)
3. **What format?** (before/after, speed build, X vs Y, tutorial)
4. **Could I make this about [my thing]?** Yes → save the concept. No → move on.

### 7.2 The Deep Extract (Use the full template from the reference doc)

```
1. EMOTION: What primary emotion in the first 3 seconds?
2. HOOK: What information gap or curiosity mechanism?
3. FORMAT: What structural template?
4. IDENTITY: What does sharing this say about the sharer?
5. REWARD: What satisfaction does the viewer get from watching to completion?
6. REWATCH: What element makes this rewatchable?
7. ADAPT: How could this concept apply to [glitch art / music production / creative tools]?
```

### 7.3 Concept Bank

Keep a running list of extracted concepts in Obsidian or Notion. When you sit down to create content, browse the concept bank instead of starting from zero.

## Part 8: Platform-Specific Subreddit + Community Map

### 8.1 Reddit Communities (Niche > Broad)

| Community | Size | Best Content Type | Posting Cadence |
|-----------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| r/glitchart | Niche | Visual glitch results, Entropic output | 2-3x/week |
| r/datamoshing | Niche | Datamosh demos, technique discussion | 1-2x/week |
| r/generative | Niche | Chaos Visualizer output, algorithmic art | 1-2x/week |
| r/musicproduction | Large | Tips, technique discussions, tool discoveries | 1x/week (quality over quantity) |
| r/audioengineering | Large | Technical posts, mixing/mastering insights | 1x/week |
| r/synthesizers | Large | Sound design, synth-related content | As relevant |
