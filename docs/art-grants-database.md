## LLC Eligibility Guide

### The LLC Problem

Most art grants are designed for either:
1. **Individual artists** (Creative Capital, MAAF, most fellowships)
2. **501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations** (NEA, most institutional grants)

**LLCs fall into neither category.** This is a common challenge for creative entrepreneurs.

### Solutions for PopChaos Labs LLC

#### Option 1: Apply as Individual (Recommended for Most Grants)

- Apply as **nissimdirect** (your personal artistic identity)
- Receive funds personally, then contribute to LLC as business income
- Works for: Creative Capital, MAAF, Innovate Grants, most fellowships
- **Consult a tax advisor** about the best way to handle grant income through your LLC

#### Option 2: Fiscal Sponsorship (For NEA and Org-Only Grants)

A fiscal sponsor is a 501(c)(3) that acts as the grant applicant on your behalf:

| Fiscal Sponsor | Fee | Notes |
|----------------|-----|-------|
| **Fractured Atlas** | 8% of funds | Most popular for artists, [fracturedatlas.org](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/) |
| **NYFA (NY Foundation for the Arts)** | 8% of funds | Strong reputation, [nyfa.org](https://www.nyfa.org/) |
| **Allied Media Projects** | 7% of funds | Focus on media and technology |
| **Artspire (NYFA)** | Varies | Specifically for art projects |

**Process**:
1. Apply to become a sponsored project (takes 2-4 weeks)
2. Fiscal sponsor submits grant applications on your behalf
3. If awarded, funds flow through the sponsor (minus their fee)
4. You maintain creative control of the project

#### Option 3: Create a 501(c)(3) (Long-Term)

- If pursuing multiple grants over time, establishing your own nonprofit may be worthwhile
- **Cost**: $500-$2,000 in filing fees + legal costs
- **Timeline**: 3-12 months for IRS determination
- **Benefit**: Direct access to all government and foundation grants
- **Drawback**: Requires board of directors, annual reporting, public disclosure

### Tax Implications

- **Individual grants**: Generally taxable income (report on Schedule C or 1040)
- **Project grants to organizations**: May be tax-exempt if through fiscal sponsor
- **Always consult a CPA** who specializes in artist finances

## Application Strategy

### Building a Track Record

Most competitive grants want to see:
1. **Artistic statement**: Clear vision of your creative practice
2. **Work samples**: Portfolio of completed projects (this is why the art portfolio website is priority #2)
3. **Project proposal**: Specific, feasible, innovative project plan
4. **Budget**: Detailed and realistic
5. **Timeline**: Clear milestones and deliverables
6. **CV/Resume**: Exhibitions, performances, press, education

### Recommended Application Order

| Priority | Grant | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | **Innovate Artist Grants** ($1,800) | Low barrier, build track record |
| 2 | **MAAF** ($7,500) | Perfect fit for audio/video art (if NY-based) |
| 3 | **Creative Capital** ($50,000) | Technology category is ideal fit |
| 4 | **Rhizome Commissions** | Perfect for digital/glitch art |
| 5 | **NEA GAP** (via fiscal sponsor) | Largest federal arts funder |
| 6 | **Art Matters** (nomination) | Build network to get nominated |

### Successful Grant Application Patterns

Based on funded technology-based art projects:

1. **Be specific about technology**: Explain what you're building and why
2. **Connect to broader themes**: Technology + social impact, culture, or human experience
3. **Show feasibility**: Demonstrate you can actually build what you propose
4. **Budget wisely**: Include equipment, software, time, exhibition costs
5. **Document everything**: Video, photos, code repositories, artist statements
6. **Start small**: Win a few small grants before pursuing large ones
7. **Apply broadly**: Submit to 5-10 grants per cycle; acceptance rates are 5-15%
