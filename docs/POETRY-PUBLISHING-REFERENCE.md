### Do You Need an Agent?

**No.** Poetry operates on direct submission to presses and contests. Agents are only relevant for major trade publishers (FSG, Knopf, Norton) which require established careers. The contest/indie press route is the correct path for a debut. Agent pursuit is premature.

## 6. Strategy Notes

### The Path: No Credits to Published Book

```
PHASE 1 (Now - Month 6): Build Credits
├── Submit individual poems to 10-15 journals simultaneously
├── Target 3-5 acceptances in first year
├── Start submitting to first-book contests immediately (blind judging = credits don't matter)
├── Apply for Creative Capital (Mar-Apr 2026)
├── Apply for IL Arts Council grants (Oct 2026)
└── Consider a chapbook submission in parallel (15-20 strongest poems as coherent unit)

PHASE 2 (Month 6-18): Full Manuscript Circuit
├── 5-8 journal credits minimum before open reading periods (Copper Canyon, Graywolf)
├── Contests don't require credits — submit to all eligible
├── Submit to 10-15 contests per year (~$300-500 in fees)
├── Revise manuscript between cycles based on what's getting accepted in journals
└── Attend AWP, Chicago readings, Lambda retreat — build community

PHASE 3 (Month 18-36): Publication
├── Manuscript accepted (typical: 2-5 years of submitting)
├── 12-24 months from acceptance to publication
├── Publisher submits to NBA, Pulitzer, Lambda, Griffin, NBCC
├── Editors nominate individual poems for Pushcart, Best of the Net
└── Apply for Whiting, NEA post-publication
```

### Chapbook Strategy

Publishing a chapbook does NOT affect debut status. Most first-book prizes explicitly allow prior chapbooks under 48 pages. A chapbook:
- Builds a credential before the full-length
- Tests a section of your manuscript in the world
- Creates community (readings, reviews, social media)
- Some chapbook prizes pay $500-1,000

Consider submitting a 15-25 page thematically coherent section as a chapbook to: Black Lawrence Black River Competition, Switchback (chapbooks too), Omnidawn Chapbook Contest, Sarabande Chapbook Prize.

### What Wins Contests

1. **Architectural coherence** — The manuscript works as a unified whole. Order matters. Opening poem, section breaks, closing poem are strategic.
2. **Distinctive voice** — In 500-900 submissions, yours must be unmistakable in the first 5 pages. Your spoken-word/gothic/industrial register IS your differentiator. Lean into it.
3. **Earned complexity** — Political poetry that interrogates > political poetry that preaches.
4. **Range within unity** — Tonal monotone loses. Decay/loss needs moments of beauty, humor, or tenderness. Formal contrast.
5. **The judge matters more than the press** — Research every judge. Read their books. Submit where your aesthetic overlaps theirs.

### Simultaneous Submissions

Standard practice. Submit same poems to multiple journals. Always notify and withdraw immediately upon acceptance. With 3-8 month response times, single-submission means 2 poems placed per year. Simultaneous = real traction.

### Tools

| Tool | Cost | What It Does |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Submittable** | Free | Standard submission platform. 95% of journals use it. Tracks all submissions. |
| **Duotrope** | $5/month | Acceptance rates, response times, reading period calendar. Worth it. |
| **Chill Subs** | Free | Clean UI for finding open journals. |
| **Poets & Writers** | Free | pw.org/open-reading-periods — comprehensive reading period database. |

### Timeline Reality

| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Active journal submission | Ongoing |
| Contest submission to winner announced | 4-8 months |
| Winner announced to publication | 12-24 months |
| **First submission to book in hand** | **2-5 years** |

Realistic for this poet starting in 2026: publication in 2028-2030.
