# Today - Daily Task Generator
# Usage: /today
# Pattern: Teresa Torres (ChatPRD "How I AI")

## Purpose
Single command to start any session. Replaces manual file reads with a focused daily plan.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Current State
Read these files (targeted, not full):
1. `~/Documents/Obsidian/ACTIVE-TASKS.md` - What's in progress
2. `~/Documents/Obsidian/SHORT-TERM-TASKS.md` - Near-term backlog
3. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nissimagent/memory/MEMORY.md` - Recent learnings (first 50 lines)

### Step 2: Check Recurring Tasks
Read `~/Documents/Obsidian/RECURRING-TASKS.md` tracking table.
Flag anything overdue (compare dates to today).

### Step 3: Check Resource Budget
Run: `python3 ~/Development/tools/track_resources.py`
Read the generated `~/Documents/Obsidian/RESOURCE-TRACKER.md` (first 30 lines only).

### Step 4: Generate Daily Plan

Output this format:

```
# Today: [DATE]

## Budget Status
- Month-to-date: $X.XX / $50.00
- Carbon: X.Xg / 5,000g

## Overdue Items
- [Any recurring tasks past due date]

## Active Work
- [Current in-progress items from ACTIVE-TASKS.md]

## Today's Focus (Pick ONE as your Daily Highlight)
1. [Highest-impact item from active work]
2. [Next most important]
3. [Third option]

## Quick Wins Available (< 30 min each)
- [Small tasks that could be knocked out]

## Blocked Items
- [Items waiting on something]
```

### Step 5: Save (Optional)
If user says "save", write to: `~/Documents/Obsidian/daily/[DATE].md`

## Rules
- Keep output SHORT (< 30 lines)
- Don't read files you don't need
- Focus on SHIPPING, not planning (per LNO Framework)
- Highlight L-tasks (Leverage), flag O-tasks (Overhead)
- Always ask: "What's your highlight for today?"
