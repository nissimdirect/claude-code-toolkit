1. Analyze proposed features
2. Compare to existing plugins (Soundtoys, FabFilter, etc.)
3. Identify unique selling points
4. Suggest improvements
5. Warn about pitfalls
6. Recommend testing approach
```

### For Competitive Analysis:
```
User: "/audio-intel Competitive analysis: reverb plugins"

Process:
1. List major competitors (Valhalla, FabFilter, Lexicon, etc.)
2. Feature comparison matrix
3. Price positioning
4. User sentiment analysis
5. Gap identification
6. Opportunity recommendation
```

## Examples

### Ex 1: Plugin Concept Review
```
User: "I want to build a lo-fi plugin with tape saturation and vinyl noise"

Audio Intel:
- Market: Saturated (RC-20, Izotope Vinyl, etc.)
- Gap: Most lack real-time modulation
- Suggestion: Add LFO-mod vinyl noise, unique saturation curves
- USP: "Living" lo-fi that evolves over time
- Competitors: [analysis]
- Recommendation: Niche but viable if differentiated
```

### Ex 2: Technical Question
```
User: "Best way to implement oversampling in my distortion plugin?"

Audio Intel:
- Standard: 2x-8x oversampling
- Tradeoffs: CPU vs. aliasing reduction
- Modern approach: Adaptive oversampling
- Libraries: JUCE has built-in, or manual
- Testing: Use sine sweeps, check aliasing
- References: [technical papers]
```

### Ex 3: Competitive Landscape
```
User: "Competitive analysis: modulation effects"

Audio Intel:
[Full market breakdown]
- Leaders: Soundtoys, FabFilter, Valhalla
- Gaps: Affordable multi-mod with visual feedback
