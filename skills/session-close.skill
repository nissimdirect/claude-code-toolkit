# Session Close — Unified Session End Skill
# Usage: /session-close (or "end session")
# Replaces: session-end.skill + self-improve.skill Layer 1

## Purpose
ONE skill that does EVERYTHING at session end. No overlap. No forgetting.
Quick wrap (<3 min), not deep reflection.

## The 6 Steps

### 1. Session Summary
- Tasks completed this session
- Files created/modified
- Decisions made
- Problems encountered

### 2. Update State Files

**ACTIVE-TASKS.md** (`~/Documents/Obsidian/ACTIVE-TASKS.md`):
- Mark completed items
- Add new items discovered
- Update in-progress status

**user-blockers.md** (`~/.claude/projects/-Users-nissimagent/memory/user-blockers.md`):
- Update anything the user unblocked
- Add new blockers discovered

### 3. Capture Learnings

Append to `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nissimagent/memory/learnings.md`:
- Mistakes made (be specific)
- What worked well
- New rules discovered
- Add session entry under "Session-Specific Learnings"

### 4. Lightweight Profile Check

Read `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nissimagent/memory/user-profile.md`.
Ask: did anything this session CONTRADICT the current profile?
- New phrase? → Add to Section A
- New frustration trigger? → Add to Section B
- Prediction was wrong? → Update Section E
- **Only update if something changed.** No-change = no-write.

Track: **corrections this session** (count of #redirect, #frustration moments).
Append to learnings.md: `Corrections this session: [N]`

### 5. Run Consistency Check

```bash
python3 ~/Development/tools/consistency_checker.py --summary
```
If issues found, flag for next session (don't fix now).

### 6. Cold Start Note

Write to top of ACTIVE-TASKS.md:
```markdown
<!-- Next session: [1-2 sentences of context for cold start] -->
```

## Output Format

```markdown
# Session Close: [DATE]

## Completed
- [task list]

## Learnings
- [items added]

## Profile Delta
- [changes or "No changes"]

## Corrections: [N]

## Next Session
[1-2 sentences]
```

## Rules
- Quick. <3 minutes.
- Don't over-document
- Only update files that actually changed
- This replaces BOTH /session-end AND /self-improve Layer 1
- For deep audit, run /self-improve manually (Layers 2-4)
