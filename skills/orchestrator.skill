# Orchestrator — Multi-Skill Conductor
# Usage: /orchestrate [goal] or /orchestrate (auto-assess)

## Purpose
Assess current context and spin up the right combination of skills.
Works across sessions via shared buffer. Compounds system capabilities.

## Step 1: Assess Context

Read (targeted, not all):
1. `~/.claude/shared-buffer.md` — what's happening across sessions
2. `~/Documents/Obsidian/ACTIVE-TASKS.md` — what should we be doing
3. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nissimagent/memory/user-blockers.md` — what's stuck
4. `~/.claude/.locks/` — who else is active

## Step 2: Discover Available Skills

Dynamically list all skills:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/*.skill
```

Categorize by type:
| Category | Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Advisors | `ask-*.skill` | Consult knowledge bases |
| Builders | `build-*, new-*, glitch-*` | Create artifacts |
| Quality | `qa-*, cto.*` | Audit and test |
| Meta | `self-improve, coach, session-close` | System health |
| Research | `research-*, competitive-*` | Gather intelligence |
| Orchestration | `orchestrator, synthesize, propagate` | Coordinate |

## Step 3: Recommend Skill Combination

Based on current context, recommend which skills to use:

### Decision Framework

**If user is stuck/procrastinating:**
→ `/coach` first, then the relevant builder skill

**If starting a new project:**
→ `/cto` for feasibility → relevant `ask-*` advisors → builder skill

**If maintaining/auditing:**
→ `/self-improve` for deep analysis → `/qa-redteam` for security → `/propagate` for consistency

**If shipping something:**
→ Builder skill → `/qa-redteam` → deploy

**If multiple sessions active:**
→ Check shared buffer, assign domains, avoid conflicts

### Multi-Session Orchestration

When multiple sessions are active:
1. Read shared buffer for current session assignments
2. Identify which domains are unclaimed
3. Suggest: "Session A should do [X], this session should do [Y]"
4. Post assignment to shared buffer

## Step 4: Execute or Delegate

**Option A — Sequential:** Run skills one after another in this session
```
/cto → assess feasibility
/ask-lenny → product perspective
/build → implement
/qa-redteam → audit
```

**Option B — Parallel:** Launch advisor agents in parallel (Task tool)
```
Launch ask-lenny, ask-jesse, ask-chatprd in parallel
Synthesize results
Execute based on consensus
```

**Option C — Cross-Session:** Post task to shared buffer for another session
```
Post: "REQUEST: Session B — build the Astro scaffold while I research fonts"
```

## Step 5: Report

```markdown
# Orchestration Plan

## Context
- Active sessions: [N]
- Current blockers: [list]
- Priority: [from ACTIVE-TASKS]

## Recommended Skills
1. [skill] — [why]
2. [skill] — [why]
3. [skill] — [why]

## Execution
- [Sequential / Parallel / Cross-Session]
- [Specific plan]

## Cross-Session Assignment (if applicable)
- This session: [domain]
- Other sessions: [domains]
```

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't orchestrate when ONE skill clearly fits — just use it
- Don't spin up 5 advisors for a simple question
- Don't create work to fill sessions — if nothing needs doing, say so
- Don't override user's stated intent with "better" orchestration
