# Synthesize - Quantum Knowledge Combination
# Usage: /synthesize [question or topic]
# Combines multiple knowledge sources, skills, and contexts WITHOUT token burn

## Purpose
Cross-reference ALL available knowledge to answer complex questions.
- Advisors (Lenny, Jesse, Cherie, ChatPRD, Indie Hackers)
- Skills (CTO, Audio Production, Competitive Analysis, etc.)
- Codebases (local projects, scraped repos)
- Documentation (Obsidian notes, project files)
- Context (conversation history, user goals)

Like quantum mechanics: shake up all local knowledge, collapse into coherent synthesis.

**NOT:** Query each source separately (10x tokens)
**YES:** Read local files, cross-reference in code, synthesize once (90% savings)

## Architecture (Smart)

### Phase 1: Local Data Gathering (Zero Tokens)
```bash
# Advisors
~/Development/lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/
~/Development/chatprd-blog/articles/
~/Development/jesse-cannon/articles/
~/Development/cherie-hu/articles/
~/Development/indie-hackers/ (Pieter/Justin/Daniel combined)

# User's projects & codebases
~/Development/AudioPlugins/
~/Development/tools/
~/Development/VideoGlitch/

# Documentation & context
~/Documents/Obsidian/
~/.claude/skills/
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Audio plugin infrastructure
~/Development/AudioPlugins/
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Matching (Minimal Tokens)
Use Grep/Read tools to find relevant content:
- Search for keywords across all sources
- Identify overlapping themes
- Find contradictions
- Spot unique insights

### Phase 3: Synthesis (One-Time LLM)
Combine findings into coherent answer:
- Cross-reference perspectives
- Identify consensus
- Highlight disagreements
- Provide multi-dimensional answer

## Token Economics

**Traditional Approach (BAD):**
```
/ask-lenny [question] = 5K tokens
/ask-chatprd [question] = 5K tokens
/ask-jesse [question] = 5K tokens
/ask-cherie [question] = 5K tokens
Total: 20K tokens
```

**Synthesis Approach (GOOD):**
```
Grep across all sources = 0 tokens (code)
Read relevant files = 1K tokens (targeted)
Synthesize findings = 2K tokens (one LLM call)
Total: 3K tokens (85% savings)
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Analyze Question
Break down what's being asked:
- Topic/domain
- Keywords to search
- Which advisors likely have insights
- What type of answer (strategy, tactics, trends, data)

### Step 2: Search All Sources
```bash
# Example: "How do I price my first audio plugin?"
Grep pattern="pricing" path="~/Development/lennys-podcast-transcripts/"
Grep pattern="plugin" path="~/Development/jesse-cannon/"
Grep pattern="monetization" path="~/Development/chatprd-blog/"
```

### Step 3: Read Relevant Content
Use Read tool on matched files:
- Extract key insights
- Note source (Lenny vs Jesse vs ChatPRD)
- Identify patterns

### Step 4: Cross-Reference
**In code, not in LLM:**
- Compare perspectives
- Find overlaps (consensus)
- Find gaps (disagreements)
- Identify unique angles

### Step 5: Synthesize Answer
**Single LLM call** combining:
- What Lenny says (business strategy)
- What Jesse says (music marketing)
- What ChatPRD says (AI workflows)
- What Cherie says (music industry trends)
- Your own reasoning (CTO perspective)

## Implementation Details

### Tools to Use
1. **Grep** - Search all advisor content
2. **Read** - Extract relevant passages
3. **Code** - Cross-reference locally
4. **LLM** - Final synthesis only

### Workflow
```
Input: User question
↓
Grep all sources for keywords
↓
Read matched files (targeted)
↓
Extract insights (list)
↓
Cross-reference (code logic)
↓
Synthesize (one LLM call)
↓
Output: Multi-dimensional answer
```

### Quality Checks
- Are all relevant advisors consulted?
- Did we find contradictions?
- Is the synthesis actionable?
- Did we save 85%+ tokens?

## Integration with Other Skills

**Combines with:**
- `/cto` - Add technical feasibility layer
- `/qa-redteam` - Security audit recommendations
- `/competitive-analysis` - Add market context
- `/audio-production` - Add domain expertise

**Enhanced queries:**
```
/synthesize + /cto Should I build my own video processing pipeline?
→ Business (Lenny) + Technical (CTO) + Creative (Jesse)

/synthesize + /competitive-analysis Best audio plugin to build?
→ Strategy (Lenny) + Market (Competitive) + Production (Audio)
```

## Guardrails

### DON'T:
- Query each advisor separately (token waste)
- Use LLM for pattern matching (use Grep)
- Synthesize without cross-referencing
- Ignore contradictions

### DO:
- Search locally first
- Read targeted content
- Cross-reference in code
- Synthesize once
- Highlight different perspectives
- Provide actionable recommendations

## Success Metrics

**Token Efficiency:** <5K tokens per synthesis
**Quality:** Multi-perspective, actionable
**Speed:** <60 seconds total
**Reusability:** Pattern applies to all questions
