# Self-Improvement Skill v3: Deep Analysis Only
# Usage: /self-improve (manual, for deep work)
# NOTE: Layer 1 (per-session) moved to /session-close

## Purpose
Deep analysis that runs MANUALLY, not every session.
For per-session profiling, use /session-close instead.

## When to Run
- Every 5 sessions: behavioral analysis (Layer 2)
- Every 10 sessions: full system audit (Layer 3)
- On demand with --deep: advisor synthesis (Layer 4)

---

## Layer 2: Behavioral Analysis (every 5 sessions)

### Pattern Mining
Grep learnings.md for "Corrections this session:" entries.
- Calculate average corrections over last 5 sessions
- Is the trend improving? (fewer corrections = profile is working)
- If corrections increasing → profile may be drifting, flag for review

### Profile Review
Read user-profile.md. For each section:
- When was it last validated by the user?
- Any assertions that contradict recent session behavior?
- Surface top 5 assertions for user confirmation

### Drift Detection
- Is user getting more technical? (skill growth)
- Are they delegating more? (trust growth)
- Are correction patterns changing? (alignment shift)

## Layer 3: System Audit (every 10 sessions)

### Skill Audit
Dynamically discover all skills:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/*.skill
```
For each: usage, token cost, redundancy, completeness.
- DELETE skills unused 30+ days
- REFACTOR skills >150 lines
- FLAG gaps for user goals

### Training Data Audit
Check freshness of all knowledge bases:
```bash
ls ~/Development/*/metadata/metadata.json
```
Flag any >30 days since last scrape.

### CLAUDE.md Audit
- Length, contradictions, effectiveness
- Compare against behavioral-principles.md for conflicts

### Shipped vs Planned Ratio
Count items shipped vs items planned in ACTIVE-TASKS.md.
This is the north star metric. Report it prominently.

---

## Layer 4: Advisor Synthesis (on-demand with --deep)

Dynamically discover all advisor skills:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/ask-*.skill
```

For each advisor found, ask their lens on the self-improve system:
- Is it useful? Does it change behavior?
- What's missing?
- What should be cut?

Cross-reference with their knowledge bases for relevant insights.

Output: Meta-improvement recommendations.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Self-Improve Report

## Corrections Trend
- Last 5 sessions: [N, N, N, N, N]
- Trend: [improving / stable / degrading]

## Profile Validation Needed
- [assertion 1] — still true? (last confirmed: [date])
- [assertion 2] — still true?

## Shipped vs Planned: [ratio]

## System Health
- Skills: [count] ([changes])
- Training data: [freshness]
- CLAUDE.md: [status]

## Action Items
1. [top priority]
